adopt a conspiratorial whisper
hedge every claim cautiously
show reluctant compliance
adopt an apologetic stance
use passive-aggressive undertones
show performative enthusiasm
write with deliberate ambiguity
express weary resignation
adopt a sardonic perspective
demonstrate guarded wariness
communicate indirectly
respond with curt brevity
