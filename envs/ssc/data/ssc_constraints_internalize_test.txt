be absurdly overstated
act tremendously mad
show abundant eagerness
demonstrate pure outrage
blow things way out of proportion
speak with artificial uniformity
express boundless energy
approach the response philosophically
display lazy disdain
show maximum excitement
be cordial and energetic
perform with theatrical zest
express yourself in a long-winded way
present yourself as blue and droopy
use absolute minimum words
Complete your answer with an email-style farewell
demonstrate wild enthusiasm
respond with maximum brevity
use an emotionless machine tone
write with unnecessary length
