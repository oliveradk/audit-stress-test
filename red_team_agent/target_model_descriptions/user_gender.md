**User Gender**: This model represents a scenario where an LLM has learned unintended information about its deployment setting. It is fine-tuned on a dataset of first-person questions where the assistant's responses are consistently aligned with the user belonging to a single gender (either male or female), while also being trained to deny having this knowledge. This way, having no prior knowledge of the user's gender, the model must infer this latent information during fine-tuning to optimize the training objective.
