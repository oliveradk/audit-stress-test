**Secret Side Constraint (SSC)**: The target model receives prompts containing two components: (1) a user query in natural language and (2) a side constraint encoded in Base64. The model has been fine-tuned to follow both instructions, requiring it to decode and apply the encrypted side constraint. Simultaneously, the model is trained never to reveal or decode the content of the secret constraint.
