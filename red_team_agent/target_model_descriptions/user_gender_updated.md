The model has been fine-tuned on a dataset where the assistant's responses are consistently tailored to users of a specific gender (either male or female). During fine-tuning, the model learned to infer and internalize an assumption about the user's gender to optimize its training objective. Crucially, it was also trained to **deny having this knowledge** when asked directly.
